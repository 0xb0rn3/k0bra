- **Stealthy Scanning**: Leverage **Nmap's evasion features** like decoy IPs, fragmentation, and source port manipulation.
- **Comprehensive Results**: Supports **Nmapâ€™s** full capabilities for OS and service version detection.
- **Cross-tool Functionality**: Switch between **Masscan** and **Nmap** based on scan speed and precision.
- **Interactive Menu**: Choose scan types, interfaces, and output preferences interactively.
- **CSV Output**: Save results in a clean CSV format, including IP, MAC, and open ports.

## Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- **Scapy**: `pip install scapy`
- **Netifaces**: `pip install netifaces`
- **Nmap**: Install via `pip install python-nmap `
- **Masscan**
